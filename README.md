**Automated Detection and Masking of Personally Identifiable Information in Text**  

**Project Overview**   
In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has become a crucial concern across various industries. This project focuses on developing an automated system for detecting and masking PII in textual data using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The objective is to build a robust and generalizable model capable of identifying and anonymizing diverse PII types across multiple domains while ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.  

**Problem Statement**   
Traditional PII detection methods rely on rule-based approaches or pattern-matching techniques, which are often domain-specific, inflexible, and prone to high false positive and negative rates. As data-driven applications continue to expand, there is an urgent need for a more sophisticated, context-aware system that can accurately identify and mask sensitive information in unstructured text.  

**Project Objectives**   
Develop and evaluate machine learning models for detecting and masking various types of PII.  
Compare different deep learning architectures, including BiLSTM-CRF, BERT, and hybrid models, to determine the most effective approach.  
Implement a PII masking function that effectively redacts identified sensitive entities while preserving text readability.  
Ensure adaptability to different domains, enabling the system to process diverse types of documents with high accuracy.  
Follow a structured research methodology using CRISP-DM to systematically collect, preprocess, and analyze data.  

**Methodology**    
This project follows the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, which includes the following stages:  

Business Understanding – Understanding the importance of PII protection and defining key objectives.  
Data Understanding – Analyzing a large multi-domain dataset with diverse PII categories.  
Data Preparation – Cleaning, tokenizing, and structuring data using BIO tagging for named entity recognition.  
Modeling – Implementing and evaluating multiple deep learning architectures:  
BiLSTM-CRF – A sequential model leveraging recurrent layers and CRF for structured prediction.  
BERT – A transformer-based model trained for token classification.  
Hybrid BiLSTM-CRF with BERT embeddings – Combining contextual embeddings with sequential modeling for improved accuracy.  
Evaluation – Measuring model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective PII detection.  
Deployment – Developing a masking mechanism to redact detected PII while maintaining data utility.  


**Results**  
The BERT-based model demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 95% F1-score, significantly outperforming traditional rule-based and standalone RNN models. The hybrid BiLSTM-CRF with BERT embeddings also showed strong performance by leveraging both contextual word representations and structured prediction techniques. The system effectively detected 24 diverse PII categories, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates, locations, and financial data.
